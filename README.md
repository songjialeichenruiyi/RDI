# RDI: A adversarial robustness evaluation metric for deep neural networks based on model statistical features
## model_dataset.py
Code for training different models with natural samples
## model_dataset_adv.py
Use PGD attack method to generate dversarial samples under different models and different data sets
## model_dataset_adv_train.py
Code for adversarial training using adversarial examples
## PGD_attack.py RFGSM.py Square_Attack.py
Codes for three attack methods
## RDI.py
The code of the RDI calculation method needs to pass in the feature vectors, and the feature vectors extraction is placed in the code of each model training.
